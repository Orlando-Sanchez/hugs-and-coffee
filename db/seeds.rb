# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# 10.times do
#   email = Faker::Internet.email
#   password = Faker::Internet.password(min_length: 10, max_length: 20)
#   user = User.create!(email: email, encrypted_password: password)

  # firstname = Faker::Name.first_name
  # lastname = Faker::Name.last_name
  # fullname = firstname+" "+lastname
  # artist = "artist"
  # dollar_sign = "$"
  # profile = Profile.new(
  # fullname = Faker::Internet.username,
  # occupation = Faker::Job.title,
  # biography = Faker::Lorem.paragraphs(number: 2),
  # coffee_price = Faker::Number.decimal(l_digits: 1, r_digits: 2),
  # currency_sign = Faker::Currency.symbol)
  # profile.user = user
  # profile.save!

  # 4.times do
  #   quantity = Faker::Number.between(from: 1, to: 10)
  #   multiplier = Multiplier.create!(quantity: quantity)  
  #   multiplier.profile = profile
  # end
  # subtitle = Faker::Lorem.sentence(word_count: 3)
  # publication = Publication.new(subtitle: subtitle)
  # publication.profile = profile
  # publication.save!
